## Predicting NCAA Basketball Tournament Success with Machine Learning Models
### Abstract
In this paper, we attempt to predict the success of teams participating in the 2015-2019 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournaments using Machine Learning algorithms and find which statistical features give the highest likelihood for games won. By training our data on multiple regression models, we find the best model to be Lasso Regression. We also find that that Adjusted Defensive Efficiency has the largest impact on how far a team makes it in the tournament. Using our test results, we predict Kansas as the winner of the 2020 NCAA Tournament that had been canceled due to COVID-19.
